            Autumn, also known as fall, is one of the four temperate seasons.
            Autumn is the season when the duration of daylight becomes
            noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. One of
            its main features in temperate climates is the striking change in
            colour for the leaves of deciduous trees as they prepare to shed.
